Using these files 2 maps can be created:
First map is created by mapafrica_1.R script and dataset named nasal2.csv. The map illustrates different systems of nasal consonants (there are 9 systems). Summary, some explanations and bibpliography are described in file summary and bibliography.pdf (in Russian). 
Second map is created by mapafrica_strange_nasals.R script and strange.csv and illustrates rare nasal consonants described in some grammatics.
